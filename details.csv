Things, The Move, The Impact, The Upshot
b'Obamacare',"b'The move: House Republicans had tried for years to cut off subsidies that helped low-income Obamacare enrollees with the co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles that come with their health plans. In 2017, Trump finally did it through administrative means after the GOP effort to replace the law fell apart \xe2\x80\x94 and he immediately drew intense outcry from Democrats and policy experts who called the move \xe2\x80\x9csabotage.\xe2\x80\x9d '","b'The impact: The health exchanges didn\xe2\x80\x99t collapse, as Trump had hoped. Instead, health plans and states quickly figured out a way to claw back the federal dollars they lost: They built the costs of the subsidies into premiums for Obamacare\xe2\x80\x99s benchmark \xe2\x80\x9csilver\xe2\x80\x9d policies. This meant that premiums for these \xe2\x80\x9csilver\xe2\x80\x9d plans spiked and as a result, the premium subsidies the government had to pay for low-income enrollees vastly increased. The concept, known as \xe2\x80\x9csilver-loading,\xe2\x80\x9d grew government subsidizing of the exchanges by upwards of $20 billion per year. '","b'The upshot: While Trump\xe2\x80\x99s moves made Obamacare plans increasingly unaffordable for the unsubsidized, Democrats quickly tamped down their criticisms since it accomplished their goal of significantly boosting funding for Obamacare. The incoming Biden administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to reverse course. \xe2\x80\x94 Susannah Luthi'"
b'Strategy',"b'The move: The 2018 strategy rewired the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s vast bureaucracy away from a focus on fighting insurgents and terrorists in the Middle East toward a long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. As a result, the military is changing how it trains personnel, which technologies it buys, and the geographic areas of the world where it prioritizes its forces. '","b'The impact: Already it has led to a reordering of the Pentagon budget and new investments supported by a bipartisan majority in Congress, including billions of dollars to beef up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific. '","b'The upshot: Despite differences in tone and rhetoric, this is a refocusing of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 military posture that is expected to continue in the Biden administration. \xe2\x80\x94 Bryan Bender '"
b'Coronavirus',"b'The move: Despite pressure from Democrats, unions and worker advocates, OSHA refused to set rules for worker safety during the pandemic. Republicans defended the decision by saying the burden on companies struggling to stay afloat amid the recession would be too great. In the absence of a standard, employers have only had to comply with a mix of optional guidelines, able to pick and choose what precautions they take. '","b'The impact: The agency\xe2\x80\x99s backseat approach to workplace safety means Americans still face a dangerously unpredictable range of safety conditions when they show up to work. Though OSHA has cited some companies for coronavirus-related transgressions, many large corporations received meager fines even in cases where workers died from Covid-19. Democrats have attempted to include language mandating an emergency temporary standard in future rounds of pandemic aid \xe2\x80\x94 but their efforts have been unsuccessful.'",b'The upshot: One of the first things a Biden administration will likely move to do is instruct OSHA to step up worker safety enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 including by enacting an emergency standard and ramping up penalties on violators. Biden\xe2\x80\x99s campaign also pledged to double the number of OSHA investigators to enforce the law and existing standards. \xe2\x80\x94 Eleanor Mueller '
b'Oversight',"b'The move: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt showed up for Congressional hearings that decided the fate of the department\xe2\x80\x99s budget, but otherwise refused invitations from the House Natural Resources Committee to defend its policy actions under Trump. The attitude flowed down to sub-agency heads as well. Scott Angelle, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s head of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the office in charge of setting offshore drilling safety standards, told the committee he was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo busy\xe2\x80\x9d to answer the committee\xe2\x80\x99s request that he explain its practice of handing out waivers on regulation put in place in response to the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster.'","b'The impact: The foot-dragging in providing even basic information stretched to written requests from Congress and the public. House Democrats complained that Interior, in responding to written questions, would flood the zone with thousands of documents that had little relation to the topic at hand and even include pages containing nothing but Wingdings font. Interior was also sued by outside groups and subject to an internal watchdog audit over complaints it was slow walking public information requests. '","b'The upshot: All in all, the agency got away with it: Democrats complained but never followed through on a subpoena threat. By the final six months of the Trump administration, Interior officials completely stopped attending House hearings meant to flag issues with the department. The behavior all but guarantees that future administrations will follow suit. \xe2\x80\x94 Ben Lefebvre '"
b'Cannabis',"b'The move: Despite its anti-weed rhetoric, the Trump administration stood to the side as 18 states liberalized their marijuana laws from 2016 to 2020, including staunchly conservative states like Mississippi and South Dakota. Despite former Attorney General William Barr\xe2\x80\x99s anti-trust scrutiny of cannabis deals, the federal government remained relatively hands-off on marijuana policy. '","b'The impact: Cannabis is now legal in some form in 36 states, meaning that a majority of Americans have some form of legal access even though the drug remains officially illegal at the federal level. In fact, more than one-third of Americans now live in states with full legalization.'","b'The upshot: Cannabis has become a massive business, generating billions in state revenues. The move toward legalization is likely to accelerate under a Biden administration, which is expected to pressure Congress to pass legislation fixing some legal problems for cannabis companies, such as access to banking, and might even move to change its illegal status under the federal Controlled Substances Act. \xe2\x80\x94 Mona Zhang'"
b'Loan forgiveness',"b'The move: DeVos rewrote the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s rules that govern when federal student loan borrowers can have their debt wiped out as a result of their college\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, imposing stricter standards of proof. She also required the Education Department to provide only partial loan relief in many cases, a departure from the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy of providing full loan forgiveness. Congress moved to block the rules, with 10 GOP senators joining Democrats, but Trump vetoed the legislation and the new rules took effect. '",b'The impact: Borrowers seeking to have their loans wiped out because of the misconduct of their college \xe2\x80\x94 such as misleading or deceiving students about their job prospects \xe2\x80\x94 will have a tougher time proving their claims. The Education Department estimates that the Trump policy will reduce federal loan forgiveness by hundreds of millions of dollars each year. ',"b'The upshot: Biden has already committed to swiftly reversing Trump\xe2\x80\x99s changes to the rules, which are known as \xe2\x80\x9cborrower defense to repayment.\xe2\x80\x9d But he\xe2\x80\x99s facing pressure from progressives to go further and provide sweeping debt cancellations to all borrowers, regardless of whether they were defrauded. \xe2\x80\x94 Michael Stratford'"
b'Shell companies',"b'The move: The new law would require millions of business entities to report their true owners, puncturing the veil of anonymity that shell companies give to money launderers and tax evaders and making it easier for prosecutors to literally follow the money. '","b'The impact: The information businesses report to the Treasury Department would be accessible to law enforcement agencies that would have an unprecedented tool to investigate shell companies. Banks, which are responsible for policing criminal activity by their customers, would also be able to tap into the database.'",b'The upshot: Criminals will keep finding ways to operate in the shadows. But the new disclosure rules could give law enforcement leverage over their frontmen and may make it harder for bad guys to find lawyers willing to help hide their money because of the new paper trail. \xe2\x80\x94 Zachary Warmbrodt '
b'Poverty',"b'The move: In 2018, the Agriculture Department introduced a new rule that aimed to more strictly enforce certain work mandates under the program, making it more difficult for states to seek waivers from SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults who aren\xe2\x80\x99t caring for children or other dependents. '","b'The impact: 755,000 Americans have lost their access to food aid under SNAP, according to the USDA\xe2\x80\x99s own estimates. '","b'The upshot: The courts could reverse the change. In October, a judge halted the rule and said that it \xe2\x80\x9cradically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice, leaving states scrambling and exponentially increasing food insecurity for tens of thousands of Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d But the Trump administration appealed that decision in December, prolonging the legal battle. \xe2\x80\x94 Liz Crampton  '"
b'Overtime pay',"b'The move: In 2016, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Labor Department finalized a rule that would raise the salary threshold for overtime eligibility from around $24,000 to some $47,000 a year, with triennial increases. At the time, only about 6 percent of workers were eligible. But Trump\xe2\x80\x99s White House declined to defend the rule in court, and in 2019, proposed its own, much more lax rule, which would raise the threshold to about $35,000 with no scheduled raises.'","b'The impact: The Trump rule applies to just 15 percent of full-time, salaried workers, whereas the Obama rule would have applied to twice as many. That\xe2\x80\x99s at least 8 million workers who would have been eligible for overtime pay under the 2016 version and now are ineligible; some estimates place the amount of wages lost at around $1 billion annually.'","b'The upshot: Biden\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Obama administration, which proposed the original rule, and his sweeping pro-worker agenda indicate that he will likely overturn the Trump rule and issue his own overtime rule \xe2\x80\x94 though when, exactly, that will happen remains unclear. \xe2\x80\x94 Eleanor Mueller'"
b'Greenhouse gases',"b'The move: The Trump administration loosened the standards oil and gas companies had to meet for how much methane \xe2\x80\x94 the largest chemical component of natural gas and a major heat-trapping substance \xe2\x80\x94 they could allow to leak out of pipelines, storage tanks and other oil field infrastructure. Senate Republicans had failed to kill the Obama rule at the beginning of the Trump administration, leaving the White House to roll back an environmental regulation even some oil and gas companies supported as a way to keep an increasingly green-minded public on their side.'","b'The impact: Trump\xe2\x80\x99s stance was the polar opposite of what China and European countries pledged to do to rein in emissions of a gas considered one of the leading causes of climate change. The Trump rollbacks, finalized in August, were considered so out of the norm that even oil companies such as BP and Shell publicly spoke out against them. The French government stepped in to force trading firm Engie, in which it owns a stake, to reject a proposed contract to import U.S. gas, citing reputational risk. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of strict methane standards has also allowed Europe to claim the global mantle for fighting climate change. '",b'The upshot: Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rule changes are still being litigated in court and will be immediately in Biden\xe2\x80\x99s sights for reversal when he officially takes office. But reputational damage has already been done. \xe2\x80\x94 Ben Lefebvre '
b'Drones',"b'The move: In late 2019, the Interior Department temporarily stopped all non-emergency use of its mostly Chinese-made drones after officials from several agencies \xe2\x80\x94 including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice \xe2\x80\x94 warned that drones and drone equipment made in China might be used for espionage. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt further escalated efforts in October when he told department leadership that all future drone purchases should be vetted against a list of DoD-approved, U.S.-made drones. More recently the Commerce Department added China-based manufacturer DJI, which is the largest civilian drone manufacturer in the world, to a trade blacklist, citing concerns about the company\xe2\x80\x99s possible involvement in human rights abuses by the Chinese government.'","b'The impact: DJI\xe2\x80\x99s placement on the trade blacklist doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect ordinary consumers or businesses, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant blow to U.S. companies, such as Microsoft and PrecisionHawk, who do business with DJI including provide components for their drones. This is bad timing for those companies, since the FAA is getting ready to greenlight new commercial uses, such as drone-based delivery services, which will increase sales. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Congress may soon put even more restrictions on use of Chinese-made technology because of security concerns.'","b'The upshot: While a Biden administration might be less prone to take actions to disrupt the global supply chain, it also might try to avoid perceptions of being soft on China. A Biden administration might use the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s blacklist as a \xe2\x80\x9cbargaining chip\xe2\x80\x9d with the Chinese government, meaning DJI might stay on the list for some time. Biden also has expressed support for bolstering U.S. drone manufacturing, which could translate to further actions that would reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese technology. \xe2\x80\x94 Stephanie Beasley '"
b'Defense spending',"b""The move: In 2018, the Trump administration for the first time attempted a Defense Department-wide audit. An army of 1,000 outside accountants and 150 personnel from the Defense Department inspector general's office fanned out to some 600 locations and collected 40,000 pages of financial documents. ""","b'The impact: In the end, as widely expected, the Pentagon failed the audit overall; too much paperwork was missing or incomplete. Officials now predict the Defense Department won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to pass a full audit until 2027 at the earliest. But there are bright spots: for example, the first time around the military pay system, an enormous stream of dollars, came back clean. In follow-up audits conducted in 2019 and 2020, meanwhile, a few more defense agencies and military components were added to the clean column. '","b'The upshot: The overall exercise is seen as a milestone in the odyssey to someday verify where all our defense tax dollars are going. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the audit effort is helping Pentagon managers make their programs more efficient and minimize waste. Efforts to inject more accountability into Pentagon spending are likely to get even more intense during the Biden administration. \xe2\x80\x94 Bryan Bender'"
b'Taxes',"b'The move: The 2017 tax bill slashed individual and corporate tax rates and made dozens of other major changes to the tax code that affected virtually every facet of the economy, from small businesses to university endowments. '","b'The impact: The tax cuts helped goose the economy before the coronavirus struck, as unemployment fell steeply and the economy expanded, though many economists argued it was a sugar high or questioned whether a direct line could be drawn between the cuts and the good times. Also, the economic impact wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all good \xe2\x80\x94 the tax cuts also fueled record deficits. Supporters inside and outside the Trump administration still insist the cuts will pay for themselves in the long run through economic growth \xe2\x80\x94 though many economists are skeptical, or outright dismissive, of that prediction. '","b'The upshot: While the tax cuts benefited the economy in the short turn, they failed to pay political dividends for Trump. Polls showed the tax bill was never very popular, with the Democrats doing a good job of convincing voters it mainly benefited the wealthy. Biden has vowed to roll back much of the tax cut, particularly for high earners, by boosting the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent and raising the top individual income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 37 percent for those earning more than $400,000 annually. However, he could have a hard time getting that through Congress, with Democrats holding a one-vote majority in the Senate and a diminished number of House seats. \xe2\x80\x94 Toby Eckert'"
b'Robocalls',"b'The move: At the end of 2019, Trump signed into law carefully crafted bipartisan legislation designed to ensure phone companies would install technology to verify that calls were authentic and bolster federal enforcement powers. These efforts built on work already underway at the FCC and among state attorneys general to ward off the unwanted calls and crack down on the perpetrators, many of whom were slapped with record-setting fines in recent years under FCC Chair Ajit Pai. '","b'The impact: The volume of robocalls in 2020 seems to be on track to be lower than the previous two years, although the global pandemic could be affecting the numbers in ways not immediately apparent (not to mention prompting scams specific to Covid-19). '","b'The upshot: Although these efforts will provide a strong foundation for any moves under Biden to further tamp down the number of calls, businesses say they still lack the legal clarity they need to use automated phone calls and texts for legitimate communication with their customers. Biden and Congress will now face pressure to provide such clarity. \xe2\x80\x94 John Hendel '"
b'Climate science',b'The move: Officials refused to publicize dozens of studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change on the agriculture sector. The department even stopped the release of a plan on how to respond to the climate change crisis. ',"b'The impact: Perdue\xe2\x80\x99s contentious decision to relocate hundreds of scientists to Kansas City was among the reasons morale has been so low among department employees, prompting many of them to jump ship, leaving research agencies with a fraction of their former staff. '","b'The upshot: The Biden administration is facing pressure to quickly rehire scientists to get USDA research agencies back to full capacity, and they are expected to boost spending on research studying threats facing the food system, including climate change. \xe2\x80\x94 Liz Crampton '"
b'Medical records',"b'The move: Early in 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 just before coronavirus upended daily life \xe2\x80\x94 the Trump administration released a big ball of rules meant to sweep aside barriers to sharing health information. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s rules have several targets but they focus on practices like \xe2\x80\x9cinformation blocking,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby companies or providers might not release necessary data for competitive advantage, and require companies to use standardized recipes to exchange information.'","b'The impact: Not much, yet. Providers and other parts of the industry successfully argued that complying with the rules would be too heavy a lift amid the pandemic, so the Trump administration has delayed the effective date. '","b'The upshot: The provisions are, broadly speaking, popular and flow from bipartisan work beginning in the Obama administration. If anything, the biggest critics of the rules want them to be tougher and go into effect faster. For that reason, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely a Biden administration will be looking to reverse course. \xe2\x80\x94 Darius Tahir '"
b'Sexual harassment',"b'The move: In March 2017, Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution to revoke a regulation enacted under Obama the previous year that required businesses to publicly disclose any sexual harassment or labor law violations over the previous three years whenever they bid on large federal contracts. The goal of the rule was to prevent federal money from flowing to firms with a history of such infractions. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule also barred companies with federal contracts of more than $1 million from requiring that workers address claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault in private arbitration, taking away their option to sue in court. '",b'The impact: Federal contractors with a history of sexual harassment or other labor violations can win bids without having to reveal their problematic history.',"b'The upshot: Biden can reinstate the executive order, but it\xe2\x80\x99s legally murky for the Department of Labor to reissue the rule because the Congressional Review Act bars agencies from issuing \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially the same\xe2\x80\x9d regulation after it\xe2\x80\x99s been overturned by Congress. \xe2\x80\x94 Rebecca Rainey '"
b'Auto emissions',"b'The move: The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan would have required automakers to improve fuel efficiency by 5 percent per year, but the Trump administration rolled those targets back to just 1.5 percent improvement each year. '","b'The impact: Vehicle emissions represent the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and the rollback was likely the biggest climate-related action of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s term, especially as electric utilities continue to move away from coal on their own and as electric vehicles are slow to take hold in the U.S. But some of the effect was mitigated when the state of California brokered a deal with five major auto manufacturers to meet standards similar to the Obama-era ones.'","b'The upshot: The Biden administration is expected to laser in on the auto rules for reconsideration, but the multiyear lead time manufacturers need to design and test their vehicles means the gains mandated under the Obama-era rules but scaled back by Trump are all but forfeited. \xe2\x80\x94 Alex Guill\xc3\xa9n and Annie Snider '"
b'Antitrust',"b""The move: Early on, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tenure seemed to be following recent patterns by waving through major mergers like the combination of telecom giants Sprint and T-Mobile. But two Trump picks, FTC Chair Joe Simons and DOJ's Barr, have spent the past two years more aggressively looking into antitrust concerns raised by Silicon Valley. In recent months, the DOJ filed a landmark antitrust case against Google, its biggest monopolization case since the 1990s suit against Microsoft. The FTC, meanwhile, is pursuing its own watershed suit against Facebook that could see the social network broken up. ""","b'The impact: It\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to tell whether the antitrust actions will succeed in forcing changes at Google or Facebook, but they have sent a signal that there will be more scrutiny of their business practices going forward. '","b'The upshot: Both lawsuits will continue into the Biden administration \xe2\x80\x94 and possibly beyond. Major antitrust cases can take 3 to 5 years, and a trial in the Google suit likely won\xe2\x80\x99t even begin till the fall of 2023. \xe2\x80\x94 Leah Nylen'"
b'Immigration',"b'The move: The Department of Homeland Security has pushed through restrictions and changes to the H-1B visa program that allows U.S. businesses to hire high-skilled foreign workers for \xe2\x80\x9cspecialty\xe2\x80\x9c jobs. Businesses rely on these workers to fill jobs they say they can\xe2\x80\x99t fill with U.S. citizens. The administration, however, said U.S. employers are abusing the work visa because they want to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s most recent rules sought to limit the types of jobs foreign workers can apply for, while also requiring employers to pay them more. '","b'The impact: Some changes \xe2\x80\x94 including those that narrow the definition of a ""specialty occupation"" and that require employers to pay foreign workers more \xe2\x80\x94 were expected to reduce the number of approved H-1B visa petitions by one-third. Those efforts have since been halted in court. Businesses seeking these non-immigrant worker visas also saw an increase in requests to provide more evidence in their applications and a higher rate of visa denials. '","b'The upshot: Biden promised during his campaign that he would support expanding the number of high-skilled visas available, but after first reforming the temporary visa system to prevent favoring \xe2\x80\x9conly entry level wages and skills.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be a heavy lift; Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to pass comprehensive immigration reform since 1986. \xe2\x80\x94 Rebecca Rainey'"
b'Toxic chemicals',"b'The move: Trump officials muzzled scientists and civil servants at the agency and crafted narrow approaches to assessing chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 dangers that have massive loopholes. Specifically, while under the new law Congress urged EPA to consider all possible exposures to a chemical, cumulatively, whether in the water, air, through consumer uses or exposure at work. But Trump\xe2\x80\x99s EPA opted only to look at risks from exposures that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be regulated under other laws; for instance, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t weigh potential exposure to a chemical in drinking water since it could be regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s EPA also mostly whiffed statutory deadlines to finish studying risks for the first round of chemicals under the 2016 law and was slapped by a federal court for ignoring certain ways Americans are exposed to toxins. '","b'The impact: The administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach paves the way for less stringent regulation of toxic chemicals. If the Biden EPA leaves the laxer evaluations intact, its subsequent regulations will not be able to limit certain ways people are exposed \xe2\x80\x94 meaning Americans may not get comprehensive protection. While it is likely the Biden administration will take a more holistic look at future chemicals EPA reviews, it is unclear whether it will have time to re-analyze the chemicals the Trump administration already finished reviewing.'","b'The upshot: Biden\xe2\x80\x99s EPA is expected to take a more holistic approach to assessing and addressing chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 risks, but because of strict timelines set under the 2016 law, it is unclear to what extent it will be able to redo assessments done under the Trump administration. \xe2\x80\x94 Alex Guill\xc3\xa9n and Annie Snider '"
b'Internet upgrade',b'The move: Trump carried out a handful of different actions to block companies like Huawei and ZTE from getting any foothold in the U.S. telecom marketplace and limit their ability to trade with U.S. companies. These domestic actions were combined with a global full-court press in which Trump lobbied America\xe2\x80\x99s allies in Europe and beyond to avoid using Chinese network equipment in any telecom infrastructure. ',"b'The impact: Trump notched victories in countries like Britain and Australia, who made decisions to reject Huawei from their domestic 5G buildouts. The administration also nailed down plans to force smaller U.S. telecom carriers to rip out and replace any scattered gear from Huawei and ZTE being used in their networks. '","b'The upshot: Although many expect Biden to take a more multilateral approach, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s concerns won bipartisan backing within the U.S. and are likely to keep dominating global and domestic talks. Many countries are still mulling whether they share the alarm coming from U.S. officials. \xe2\x80\x94 John Hendel '"
b'Farm aid',"b'The move: Trump\xe2\x80\x99s USDA steered billions in subsidies to farmers suffering from tariffs imposed by foreign countries as a consequence of the president\xe2\x80\x99s trade wars, an amount that far outpaced the massive auto bailout in 2008.'","b'The impact: The vast majority of the aid went to traditional row crop farmers, many of whom were part of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s political base. Government payments are forecast to be at their highest level ever and account for nearly 40 percent net farm income this year. '","b'The upshot: Biden faces a difficult choice in deciding whether to continue the payments: The effects of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s trade war will stick around well into 2021, and producers have come to rely on the assistance to stay in business. \xe2\x80\x94 Liz Crampton'"
b'Banking',b'The move: The smallest banks won relaxed mortgage regulations and streamlined capital requirements while escaping restrictions intended to discourage risky bets in bank trading. A number of large lenders escaped Federal Reserve rules targeted at the biggest \xe2\x80\x9csystemically important\xe2\x80\x9d banks. One of the most controversial provisions in the legislation shields small lenders from mortgage disclosure requirements intended to help fight discrimination. The bill\xe2\x80\x99s opponents warned that it would hurt consumers and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary at a time when the industry was racking up record profits. ',"b'The impact: Since the passage of the legislation, large banks that lobbied for the looser restrictions have begun to merge. SunTrust and BB&T combined in 2019 to form Truist, the eighth-biggest U.S. bank at more than $504.3 billion in assets. PNC, the country\xe2\x80\x99s 10th-largest lender, agreed to buy the U.S. operations of BBVA to form another mega-bank.'","b'The upshot: Even with Democrats in control of Congress, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely they will try to undo the law, which the party\xe2\x80\x99s centrists helped pass. Biden\xe2\x80\x99s nominees to regulatory agencies may reconsider some of the rules drafted to execute the legislation but it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be a top priority. \xe2\x80\x94 Zachary Warmbrodt '"
b'Social media',"b'The move: Trump signed an executive order in May asking federal agencies to narrow Section 230\xe2\x80\x99s liability protections, which Republicans say enable Silicon Valley censorship of conservatives. Trump has also taken an unusually active role in pushing his allies at federal agencies and in Congress to weaken the legal shield. '",b'The impact: Pressure from Trump prompted the Federal Communications Commission to launch a controversial rulemaking process to \xe2\x80\x9cclarify\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of Section 230. The Justice Department unveiled its own proposal to pare it back. And congressional Republicans once wary of changing the law have rallied around Trump\xe2\x80\x99s efforts by introducing bills to do just that.',"b'The upshot: While there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for revamping the law, those GOP-led efforts focused on the bias charges are likely to be blocked by Democrats in Congress. \xe2\x80\x94 Cristiano Lima '"
b'Environmental impacts',"b'The move: In July, the White House Council on Environmental Quality issued sweeping policy changes setting shorter deadlines for agencies to complete environmental reviews and drastically reducing the scope of environmental impacts federal agencies should consider. Under the new rule, agencies need only consider emissions caused by the building of a project but not the use of the project, such as increased vehicle emissions caused by a highway expansion.'",b'The impact: New projects can be more polluting or damaging to the environment over the long term and still be approved \xe2\x80\x93 and community groups will have less leverage to challenge them. ',"b'The upshot: The Department of Transportation is moving forward with its effort to implement the new rule, despite multiple petitions to hold off. Five separate lawsuits are challenging the Trump changes to NEPA policy; however, it is unlikely the Biden Administration will continue to defend the changes in court, which makes is more likely they will be overturned. \xe2\x80\x94 Tanya Snyder'"
b'Artificial intelligence',b'The move: Trump in 2019 signed an executive order aimed at boosting the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s role in promoting the development of AI and at providing guidance to agencies on how to regulate the technology. The White House also threw its support behind European efforts to develop global AI standards. ',"b'The impact: Even as Trump disengaged from other areas of international rulemaking, his actions helped give the U.S. a global presence in the international debate over how to regulate AI. '","b'The upshot: Industry leaders are still looking for the federal government to seize an even more active role in championing AI development, and to provide more funding for R&D. And they\xe2\x80\x99re hoping the incoming Biden administration will go much farther than Trump did. \xe2\x80\x94 Cristiano Lima'"
b'Housing segregation',"b'The move: Carson scrapped the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, which threatened to withhold housing funds from cities that fail to take active steps to end segregation. The new version also revamped the agency\'s ""disparate impact"" rule to make it harder for plaintiffs to bring claims of unintentional discrimination. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gave small banks an exemption from data collection requirements that help track racial discrimination in the mortgage market. The agency also dramatically cut back on enforcing fair lending laws during the Trump administration. '","b'The impact: The reduced focus on fair housing comes as the gap in homeownership rates between Black and white Americans yawns as widely as it ever has, including when housing discrimination was legal. About 70 percent of white households own their homes, compared with about 40 percent of Black households \xe2\x80\x94 a disparity the ongoing and lopsided economic crisis is expected to exacerbate.'","b'The upshot: Because the 2015 rule was already on the books, the incoming administration can simply revoke the replacement regulation and revert to the original, although it will have to update the data tools that form the backbone of the rule. Rebuilding an aggressive enforcement division at the CFPB will take longer. \xe2\x80\x94 Katy O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell'"
b'Trade rules',b'The move: Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement supported by most other Republicans and ran roughshod over the rules-based trading system to pursue his political objective of boosting U.S. industry. He imposed tariffs on more than $350 billion worth of Chinese goods and on billions of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of steel and aluminum imports. He struck a trade deal with China that eliminates many agricultural trade barriers but left many other serious trade issues unaddressed. He also used the threat of withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement to strike a more protectionist version of the agreement with Canada and Mexico.',b'The impact: Trump elevated concerns about China\xe2\x80\x99s trade practices and acquisition of American technology to a new level and helped usher in what many now are calling a cold war between the world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest economies. He also weakened the World Trade Organization through his willingness to hamstring the group\xe2\x80\x99s dispute settlement system and to unilaterally impose tariffs to punish trading partners and protect domestic industries. ',"b'The upshot: Trump leaves office with a mixed record on trade. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement has groundbreaking provisions on labor enforcement and costly new rules for North American automakers. Trump fell far short on his promise to negotiate bilateral trade deals to make up for his decision to pull out of the TPP, although he did negotiate a number of partial trade deals with the EU, Japan and Brazil and borrowed heavily from the TPP in his NAFTA update. \xe2\x80\x94 Doug Palmer'"
b'Religion in schools',"b'DeVos tweaked a wide range of federal education policies, large and small, to bolster faith-based organizations. She changed regulations, for example, to make it easier for members of religious orders to access federal financial aid and expanded federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness to cover clergy members. And she created new protections for faith-based campus organizations at public universities. At the K-12 education level, DeVos stopped enforcing a policy that had prohibited religious organizations from providing publicly funded services\xe2\x80\x94such as tutoring, technology and counseling\xe2\x80\x94in private schools. And she opened up federal grants for charter schools to religiously affiliated organizations.'","b'Many religious education groups praised DeVos\xe2\x80\x99 changes, which she often described as effort to expand religious liberty. \xe2\x80\x9cToo many misinterpret the \xe2\x80\x98separation of church and state\xe2\x80\x99 as an invitation for government to separate people from their faith,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'","b'The Biden administration is expected to move quickly to roll back many of DeVos\xe2\x80\x99 education policies, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet clear how the incoming administration will approach her various policy tweaks to promote religious organizations.'"
